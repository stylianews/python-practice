# For example, 5 * 8 was performed by adding 5 eight times
# Use a for loop, and augmented assignment, to give the result of
# multiplying number by multiplier

number = 5
multiplier = 8
answer = 0

# add your loop after this comment
for i in range(0, multiplier):
    answer += number

print(answer)
